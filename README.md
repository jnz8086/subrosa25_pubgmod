# PUBG-mod for Sub Rosa dedicated server 0.25b

This mod adds a battle royale game mode to Sub Rosa 0.25, with the gameplay somewhat resembling that of PlayerUnknown's BattleGround.

Work in progress. Windows-only, as of right now.

## Installation

Copy the files into the folder with the [dedicated server](http://crypticsea.com/download/subrosadedicated025b.zip). (or in a separate folder, doesn't make a difference)

Launch subrosadedicated025b.exe.

Then you can either

- launch pubgmod.exe (which may not be as up-to-date)
- or open pubgmod.ct with [Cheat Engine](http://cheatengine.org/) and press "Yes".

## TODO-list

- split the code into several files
- fix the crashes and bugs
- do something about players getting stuck inside glass panes
- implement an option to disable spectators
- rework the way information about the map is stored
