Welcome to a PUBG-mod server!

Your goal is to kill everyone and be the last man standing.
Loot buildings for guns and remember to stay inside the battle zone,
which shrinks every couple of minutes. (pay attention to chat messages!)
101 health indicates that you have a parachute.
Burgers restore your health when it's below 75.
The last two players meet at the arena for the final duel.
That's all you need to know, good luck!
